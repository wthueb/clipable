# clipable

An open source, self-hosted alternative to [Streamable](https://streamable.com). Streamable's free tier used to be pretty good, but it went downhill a few years ago (understandablyâ€”hosting arbitrarily long, high quality videos for an indefinite period of time is expensive). Now you can host it yourself.

Frontend written in [Angular](https://angular.io/), backend written in [Express](https://expressjs.com).

### TODO

- dashboard showing user's uploaded clips
  - there should be a browse files button, on other pages it should just be drag n drop only (like streamable)
    - popup dialog to show upload progress
  - maybe UI for when file is hovered instead of just brightening?
- transcode clips
